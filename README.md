# OIM3690 Web Technologies - 2023 Spring - Homework 3


## Objectives: 

- Learn the basics of CSS animation and apply it to create engaging animations.
- Experiment with using an AI assistant (ChatGPT) to aid the learning process.
- Develop the skill of self-directed learning and problem solving.

---
## What to do:

- Create an animation using HTML and CSS. No JavaScript is required or needed.
  - You need to create multiple HTML pages named ***description.html***, ***v1.html***, ***v2.html***, ***v3.html*** and ***v4.html*** under this repository folder, following the steps in the Instructions section.
  - Please do not save the files under your ***WebTech*** folder.
- Document the entire learning journey step-by-step by taking screenshots and notes at each step.
  - Create a webpage named ***learn-with-AI.html*** to document the entire journey.
  - You need to take one or multiple screenshots for all the steps below marked with an emoji "📷".
  - You need to take notes for all the steps below marked with an emoji "📝".
  - If you don't know how to take screenshots or how to store screenshots as files, please ask for help including ChatGPT first before getting started.

## Instructions:

To complete this assignment, follow these steps - Remember that you need to take (a lot of) screenshot(s) in each step:

#### 1. Get familiar with CSS animation and its basic concepts.

- Log on to [ChatGPT website](https://chat.openai.com/) and initiate a conversation with ChatGPT. 
- 📷📝 Ask the following questions to learn about the basics of CSS animation: 
  - What is CSS animation and how is it used in web design?
  - What are the basic syntax and properties used to create CSS animations?
  - Can you provide me with some examples of CSS animations and how they are implemented?
- If you have any additional questions about CSS animation, feel free to ask them.
- Please make sure to take notes and screenshots of each of ChatGPT's responses. You need to incorporate them into ***learn-with-AI.html*** later.
- 📷📝 Verify the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses by researching on websites such as [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/). Take notes/screenshots accordingly.
  
#### 2. Sketch out your animation ideas.
- Think of a (very) **simple** animation effect that you want to create. It cannot be the same as the examples provided by ChatGPT in **Step 1**. The animation should be triggered by "hover" (aovid using JavaScript).
- 📷📝 Sketch your ideas on paper or using a tool like PowerPoint and save your sketches as image files.
- Describe your animation idea in detail, including your sketch files and save them in a file called ***description.html***.
  
#### 3. Create a basic version of your animation on your own.
- Using the knowledge gained from ChatGPT in **Step 1**, write code to create a basic version of your animation that you described in Step 2. 
- Save the HTML file as ***v1.html***. It's okay if this version is not well-written or even is not working correctly.  
  
#### 4. (Only after completing Step 3) Get feedback from ChatGPT and refine your animation.
- 📷📝 Prompt ChatGPT with your description to ask it to create the animation.
- Save the HTML code provided by ChatGPT as ***v2.html***.
- 📷📝 Ask ChatGPT to explain any parts of the code that you don't understand. 
- 📷📝 Observe the output by ChatGPT and see if it matches your original animation idea. If not, prompt it to modify the code in ***v2.html*** until it matches as closely as possible. We will use ***v2.html*** as starting point in **Step 5** and **Step 6**.
- 📝 Compare your ***v1.html*** with ***v2.html***, and take notes for differences you find.
  - 📷📝 If your code from **Step 3** in ***v1.html*** is not working correctly, ask ChatGPT to explain why.
  - 📝 If both codes produce very similar effects, take notes of which code is better and why.
  
#### 5. Expand and improve your animation on your own.
- Using the basic animation created from **Step 3** in ***v2.html*** as a starting point, expand and improve your animation by adding more animation features and/or making it more interesting.
- Add the new feature description to ***description.html***. Don't overwrite the file created in Step 1. Add the new feature description below existing content as part 2.
- Do not ask ChatGPT to generate the new effect for you in this step. Attempt it yourself (with the help of MDN/W3Schools/CSS-tricks).
- Save your improved animation as ***v3.html*** and add necessary comments.
- 📝 If your code still doesn't work even after making numerous attempts (Note: I know that "numerous attempts" is subjective), document the specific issue you are facing. You still need to save your code as ***v3.html*** and add necessary comments.
  
#### 6. (Only after completing Step 5) Get feedback from ChatGPT again and make final revisions.
- 📷📝 Ask ChatGPT to generate the same new animation effect by providing your new feature idea.
- Save the HTML code provided by ChatGPT as ***v4.html***.
- 📝 Compare your ***v3.html*** with ***v4.html***, and take notes for differences you find.
  - If ChatGPT's code is very different from yours, which code is closer to your original intention?
  - 📷 If your code from **Step 5** in ***v3.html*** isn't functioning properly, you can ask ChatGPT why.
  - If both code has very close effect, which code do you think is better?
  
#### 7. Create a webpage to document your learning journey.
- Create a webpage named ***learn-with-AI.html*** that contains screenshots and notes during the learning journey, including a brief explanation in each step of the process you followed to learn and apply CSS animation using ChatGPT.
- Use appropriate CSS to make this page more readable. Think of this page as an extensive demonstration of how people can learn new skills with the help of AI.
- Make sure this page contains links to all the versions of animation pages (***description.html*** and ***v1-v4.html***).
- Write a brief reflection at the end of the page that summarizes your experience and what you learned from this assignment. Please write this reflection on your own without ChatGPT's assistance.
